This is a code snippet written in a programming language called Jinja2 that generates HTML code. It defines a macro called "sidebyside" that takes in an array of two titles (Unix and Windows) and generates a row of two columns. Each column has a title and a code block. The code block is generated by calling another function called "extract_part" with some arguments. The text itself does not contain any meaningful translation.

Command line

In this lesson, we will become familiar with the *command line* - a black window used by programmers to enter text commands.

"For most of what the command line can do, you can also use something else - an icon on the desktop, a special program or editor, a web application - but these tricks have two disadvantages:
* they often differ between different computers, so fewer people will be able to help you with "your" version, and
* text can be easily copied from the command line, which simplifies collaboration via email or chat."

"At first glance, it may look unnatural, but you can get used to it."

"Although it may not be the easiest way to start programming, mastering the basics of working with the command line will definitely pay off in the long run. And that's what this course is about."

The command line (or program, also known as *console* or *terminal*;
in English, *command line*, *console*, *terminal*) is opened differently on different systems:

* Windows (Czech): Start → type "cmd" on the keyboard → Command Prompt
* Windows (English): Start → type "cmd" on the keyboard → Command Prompt
* macOS (English): Applications → Utilities → Terminal
* Linux (GNOME, Czech): Activities → search for "Terminál"
* Linux (GNOME, English): Activities → search for "Terminal"
* Linux (KDE): Main Menu → search for "Konsole"

"If you don't know what to do, try either Googling or asking someone more experienced."

After opening the console, you will be greeted by a *prompt*: a line that prompts you to enter a command. The prompt ends on Unix systems (such as Linux and macOS) with the character `$`; on Windows, it ends with the character `>`.

"Before the symbol '$' or '>' there will probably be some additional information, which is, however, omitted in these materials. And it will also be omitted in most other instructions you find on the internet. Because every computer can be a little different."

Unfortunately, the provided text cannot be translated as it appears to be a code snippet or command prompt that is specific to a certain operating system. Please provide a different text for me to translate.

According to the system, the actual commands you will be entering will also differ: Unix systems (Linux and macOS) understand different commands than Windows.

On other systems, look for settings or try
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>+</kbd> and
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>-</kbd> (or with Shift).

"První příkaz" translates to "First command" in English.

"Let's start with a command that is the same everywhere. Type `whoami` (from English *who am I?*) and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>. Your login name will appear. For example, for Helena it would look like this:"

{% call sidebyside() %}
$ whoami
helena
---
> whoami
pocitac\Helena
{% endcall %}

The text is a command prompt output in two languages, Czech and English. The command used is "whoami", which means "who am I" in English. In Czech, the output is "helena", which is a name. In English, the output is "pocitac\Helena", which means "computer\Helena". Therefore, the translation of the Czech text is "Helena".

[note]
The character `$` or `>` in the example is only there to make it clear that you are entering a command into the command line. The computer will display it, usually with something before it, so don't type it {{gnd('alone')}}! Just enter `whoami` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

Similarly, the computer will display the login name on its own.

## Current directory

The command line always works in some *directory*, also known as a *folder*. "Adresář" and "složka" are synonyms, you can use either of them.

The command that is called `pwd` or `cd` (from *print working directory* or *current directory*) will tell you in which directory you currently are in the system.

{% call sidebyside() %}
$ pwd
/home/helena/
---
> cd
C:\Users\helena
{% endcall %}

This text contains two commands used in different operating systems. The first line "$ pwd" is a command used in Unix-based systems, which stands for "print working directory". It shows the current directory in which the user is located. In this case, the user is located in the directory "/home/helena/".

The second line "> cd C:\Users\helena" is a command used in Windows operating systems, which stands for "change directory". It changes the current directory to "C:\Users\helena".

"The current directory is usually displayed in the command line prompt, before the `$` or `>` sign. But it's good to know `pwd`/`cd` just in case you get lost. Sometimes it's displayed in a shortened form. And in the future, you may have to work on a computer that displays something else before the `$` sign."

You may know something like the current directory from graphic programs where you select files: typically, the upper (or lower on Mac) part shows which directory is currently being displayed. The command line can also show files, but you have to ask for it.

"What is in that directory?"

The command `ls` or `dir` (from English *list* - enumerate, respectively *directory* - folder) will show you what the current directory contains: all files, including subdirectories, that are located in the current directory.

The text is not in Czech, it's in a computer command language. The command is listing the contents of a directory in the file system of a Windows computer. The first command "ls" lists the contents of the current directory in a Unix-based system like Linux or macOS. The second command "dir" lists the contents of the directory "C:\Users\helena" in a Windows system.

Translation: "Change of the current directory."

"The current directory can be changed using the `cd` command (from English 'change directory'). After `cd`, write the name of the directory you want to go to. If you have a directory named `Desktop` or `Plocha`, go there. Then don't forget to verify that you are in the right place."

"If you use Linux or macOS, be careful with letter case: on these systems, `Desktop` and `desktop` are two different names."

"If you use Windows, you have already used `cd` - this command behaves differently depending on whether you write something after it or not."

{% call sidebyside() %}
$ cd Desktop
$ pwd
/home/helena/Desktop
---
> cd Desktop
> cd
C:\Users\helena\Desktop
{% endcall %}

The text is a set of commands for navigating to the Desktop directory in two different operating systems: Linux and Windows. The first set of commands is for Linux and the second set is for Windows. 

In Linux, the first command "cd Desktop" changes the current directory to the Desktop directory, and the second command "pwd" prints the current working directory, which in this case is "/home/helena/Desktop".

In Windows, the first command "cd Desktop" changes the current directory to the Desktop directory, and the second command "cd" without any arguments changes the current directory to the user's home directory and then to the Desktop directory, which in this case is "C:\Users\helena\Desktop".

[note] Note for Windows
If you are switching to a directory on a different disk, for example `D:` instead of `C:`, you need to enter the name of the disk with a colon as a special command in addition to `cd` (for example, `D:`).

## Creating a directory

"How about trying to create a directory? This is done by the command 'mkdir' (from English 'make directory'). After this command, write the name of the directory you want to create - in our case 'zkouska'."

{% call sidebyside() %}
$ mkdir zkouska
---
> mkdir zkouska
{% endcall %}

This command means "create a new directory called 'zkouska'".

"When the directory is created, you can navigate to it similarly as you {{gnd('went', 'went')}} to `Desktop` or `Plocha` a moment ago."

The Czech text "cd zkouska" means "change directory to 'zkouska'" in English.

Write down the contents of the current directory using `ls` or `dir` now. One of the listed directories will be `zkouska`.

"In the graphic search tool"

"You will not often work *only* with the command line. It pays off to be able to open the current directory from the command line in other programs as well."

"Open the file browser. This program is different on every system."

I'm sorry, but the text you provided appears to be HTML code that displays images of file browsers on different operating systems (Linux, macOS, and Windows). It is not in Czech or any other language that can be translated into English.

"Maybe you know how to navigate to the directory that is active in the command line by clicking "navigate to" in this program. However, in the future, it will be more complicated, so it will be good to try copying the text from the command line and pasting it into the file browser."

"Unfortunately, it is done differently on every system. And because the well-known shortcut <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd> do something different in the command line than copying, it is probably done differently than you are used to."

First, use the command `cd` or `pwd` to have the full name of the directory `zkouska` printed out.

{% call sidebyside() %}
$ pwd
/home/helena/Desktop/zkouska
---
> cd
C:\Users\helena\Desktop\zkouska
{% endcall %}

The first line is a command in the terminal on a Unix-based system that shows the current working directory, which is "/home/helena/Desktop/zkouska". 

The second line is a command in the terminal on a Windows-based system that changes the current directory to "C:\Users\helena\Desktop\zkouska".

"Copying from the command line."

"On Linux, select the text with your mouse and then either:
* right-click and select *Copy*, or
* press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>.
(Note that in the command line, you must use Shift in addition.)"

"On macOS, select the text with your mouse and then press <kbd>⌘ Command</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>."

"On Windows, in the command prompt menu (icons in the upper left corner), select *Edit* → *Mark*, select the text with your mouse, and copy it using <kbd>Enter</kbd>."

"Opening in a file browser"

It depends on the program you are using on **Linux**. Either:
* press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>L</kbd> and insert the directory name using
  <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd>, or
* select the directory name at the top, delete it, and insert a new one using
  <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd>.
In both cases, confirm with <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

On **macOS**, select the *Go* menu → *Go to Folder*, paste the directory name using
<kbd>⌘ Command</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd> and confirm by pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

"On Windows, click on the name of the directory at the top. This will convert it to editable text. Delete it and use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd> to paste the new name instead. Confirm with <kbd>Enter</kbd>."

"Now you can look at the Desktop or in some graphic program for browsing directories: you will find that the directory was really created."

"Inserting into the command line."

"Sometimes you open a file in the file browser and you will want to switch to it in the command line. Copying the directory name should not be a problem; however, pasting it into the command line can be different than in other programs."

Linux: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd> means to press and hold the Ctrl and Shift keys together, and then press the V key. 

macOS: <kbd>⌘ Command</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd> means to press and hold the Command key (also known as the Apple key) and then press the V key.

Windows: Menu *Edit* → *Paste* means to click on the Edit menu and then click on the Paste option.

[note]
If there are spaces or other special characters such as `*#$%^()><;"?` in the name, you must enclose it in quotes in the command line: before and after the name, type `"`, for example:

```console
$ cd "my super directory"
```

However, it is better not to use spaces and special characters in file names.

Observation of Changes

"Try to see that changes you make to the text on the computer will also be reflected in the document."

"In a graphical browser that looks at the same directory that is active in your command line, create a new file or directory. Then, using the command `ls` or `dir`, check that it was actually created. Then delete it in the graphical program - and make sure in the command line that it is really deleted."

"On the computer, you have only one set of files that can be manipulated by both graphic programs and command line."

"O úroveň nahoru" translates to "One level up" in English.

"And the last thing: if you are now in the directory `Desktop/zkouska` (or `Plocha/zkouska`, `Desktop\zkouska`, etc.), how do you get back to `Desktop`?"

The command `cd Desktop` will not work: it would tell the computer to switch to the `Desktop` directory *in the current directory*. But there is no `Desktop` directory in the `zkouska` directory! On the contrary, `zkouska` is in `Desktop`. Technically speaking, the `Desktop` directory is *superior* to the current directory.

"The parent directory has a special name `..`, which consists of two dots. Go to it by typing `cd ..` and then make sure that you are really in `Desktop`."

{% call sidebyside() %}
$ cd ..
$ pwd
/home/helena/Desktop
---
> cd ..
> cd
C:\Users\helena\Desktop
{% endcall %}

The text is a command line dialogue in two different operating systems, where the user changes the current directory. 

In the first command line dialogue, the user types "cd .." which means they want to go up one level in the directory tree. Then they type "pwd" which stands for "print working directory" and it shows the current working directory, which in this case is "/home/helena/Desktop". 

In the second command line dialogue, the user types "cd .." again to go up one level in the directory tree, and then types "cd" which means they want to go to the home directory. The resulting current working directory is "C:\Users\helena\Desktop", which is in the Windows operating system.

"Another `cd ..` would move you to another parent directory - in our example, `helena`."

"Konec" translates to "The End" in English.

"There are of course many more commands."

"When you learn them, you can fully control the computer from the command line: create files, delete them, run programs, change settings, and so on. However, it would take a separate course to cover all of that, so we'll stop here."

"Try one more command, the one that closes the command line: `exit`."

The command "exit" works the same on all systems. The same applies to surprisingly many commands (except for the basic ones like "cd", "pwd", and "ls"). Therefore, in the rest of these materials, I will not use examples that are specific to a particular operating system.

"And I will be using the Unix prompt `$`. You will come across this convention in most online tutorials. If you are using Windows, it is good to get used to `$` even though your command line uses `>` instead."

"Try then what the command 'exit' does."

This is not a sentence in Czech language, it appears to be a command used in a computer terminal. It is used to exit or close the terminal window.

"And that's the introduction to the command line done."
