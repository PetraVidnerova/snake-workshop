I'm sorry, but the text you provided appears to be a code snippet in the programming language called "Jinja2". It is used in web development to generate dynamic content. It cannot be translated as it is not a natural language.

"Editor"

I'm sorry, but the text you provided appears to be a code block used in web development. It is not a sentence or phrase that can be translated.

"If you are using an editor for which we do not have instructions, you will have to set it up {{gnd('yourself', 'yourself')}}. Here are a few tips on what to watch out for."

I'm sorry, but the text you provided appears to be incomplete. It seems to be a code snippet for a web page using the Django templating language, but there is no actual text to translate. Please provide the complete text you would like me to translate.

I'm sorry, but the Czech text you provided doesn't have any meaning. It appears to be a code block used in programming. Can you please provide me with a different text to translate?

"Číslování řádků" means "Line numbering" in English.

"Make sure that your editor numbers the lines. If not, check the settings and find out how to turn it on."

## Coloring

"Save a file with the extension `.py`, for example `test.py`, and copy the following program into it:"

The given text is a Python code snippet and it does not have any meaning in Czech language. However, the code can be translated to English as:

```python
def foo():
    return "abc" * 2
```

This function returns the string "abcabc", which is the concatenation of the string "abc" repeated twice.

"If the text is automatically colored (even with colors different from here), your editor is set up correctly. Otherwise, check the settings and find out how to turn it on."

## Indentation

By pressing the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key at the *beginning of a line*, 4 spaces are inserted. For writing and sharing code in Python, it is important that there are four spaces and that they are truly spaces.

"If they are spaces, you can find out by selecting the indentation at the beginning with the mouse. If you can select individual spaces, everything is fine."

"If it is not possible to select individual spaces or if pressing <kbd>Tab</kbd> inserts a different number than 4, check the settings for options such as 'indentation size' or 'replace tabs with spaces'."

## Checking the style of source code

"Editors often support the installation of plugins that can make coding easier and help with its control. One of the most useful is a plugin for checking the correct style of source code."

Just as Czech has typographic rules in Python. For example, a space is written after a comma, but not before it. They are optional, the program will work even if they are not followed, but they help write clear code, so it is good to follow them from the beginning. These rules are described in the document [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

"Try to find and install such a plugin for your editor."

I'm sorry, but there is no Czech text provided to translate. Could you please provide the text you want to be translated?
