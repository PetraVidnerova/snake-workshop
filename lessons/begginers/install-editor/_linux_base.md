I'm sorry, but the text you provided appears to be a code snippet. It is not written in Czech or any other natural language, so it cannot be translated. It looks like a piece of code that extends a Markdown file in a lesson or tutorial.

I'm sorry, but the text you provided is a code snippet in the programming language called "Twig" that is used in web development. It is not a text in the Czech language that can be translated.

"On Linux, {{ editor_name }} is installed like any other program."

"Fedora: sudo dnf install {{ editor_cmd }}" translates to "Fedora: sudo dnf install {{ editor_cmd }}" in English. 

Note that "Fedora" is not a Czech word, but rather the name of a Linux operating system distribution. The rest of the text is a command to install a package using the DNF package manager, with the specific package name represented by "{{ editor_cmd }}".

Ubuntu
:   ```console
    $ sudo apt-get install {{ editor_cmd }}
    ```

This text is already in English and it is a command to install a text editor in Ubuntu operating system using the terminal. The actual name of the text editor is represented by the placeholder "{{ editor_cmd }}".

"If you use a different Linux, I assume that you know how to install programs. :)"

"For Windows and macOS, {{ editor_name }} can be downloaded from the [homepage]({{ editor_url }})."

I'm sorry, but the text you provided seems to be incomplete. It appears to be a code snippet for a website or app, and there is no actual text to translate. Could you please provide the full text you want me to translate?

I'd be happy to help! Please provide me with the Czech text you'd like me to translate.
