"Obarvování" translates to "Coloring".

The full sentence translates to: "Coloring works automatically, but the coloring method is selected based on the file extension - for example, `.py` for Python."

Therefore, as soon as you create a new file in this editor, you should save it under the correct name as soon as possible.
