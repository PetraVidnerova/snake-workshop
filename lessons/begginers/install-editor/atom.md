Sorry, but this text appears to be code written in the programming language called "Liquid". It is not a natural language that can be translated.

"Atomu" translates to "Atom" in English.

I'm sorry, but the text you provided doesn't seem to be a complete sentence or phrase in Czech. It appears to be a code block in a programming language. Can you please provide a different text to translate?

"In Atom, nothing needs to be set up, it works 'out of the box' as it should from production."

"Indentation and coloring will work correctly only in files with the extension `.py` (like Python). In other programming languages, indentation and coloring are done differently."

Therefore, as soon as you create a new file in this editor, you should save it under the correct name as soon as possible.

I'm sorry, but there is no Czech text provided to be translated. Please provide the text that you want to be translated.
