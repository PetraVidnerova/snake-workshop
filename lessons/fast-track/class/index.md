"Classes"

Have you already familiarized yourself with a lot of *classes* of objects that you can work with in Python: with numbers that can be added and multiplied, for example; with strings that can be converted to capital letters; with lists that you can sort; with dictionaries that can be searched.
As you continue studying programming further, you'll discover additional classes of objects: files that can be read; web pages that can be sent to a browser; buttons that can be pressed, and so on.
There are countless classes.

"And just as you can define a function using `def`, you can also create a new class {{gnd('himself', 'herself')}}. This is mainly used when you need a lot of objects in the program that have common behavior. Whole numbers, objects of the `int` class, have different values ‚Äã‚Äãbut they can all be added. Each list, object of the `list` class, can have different content, but all lists can be sorted."

"The task for this section is to create a class called *kittens*, which can have different names, but all of them can meow and eat."

"Start meowing."

The translated text is: 

```python
class Kitten:
    def purr(self):
        print("Meow!")
``` 

This is a Python class definition that creates a class called `Kitten`, with a method called `purr` that prints the string "Meow!" when called. The original Czech text used "zam≈àoukej" which is a playful way of saying "purr".

Just like functions are defined using `def`, classes have the keyword `class`, after which you write the name of the class, a colon, and then the indented body of the class. Similar to how `def` creates a function, the `class` statement creates a new class and assigns it to a variable with the given name (here `Kotatko`).

"Classes are traditionally named with a capital letter to avoid confusion with 'normal' values."

[note]
Basic classes (`str`, `int`, etc.) do not have capital letters, mainly for historical reasons - they were originally functions.

"In a class body, you can define methods that look just like functions - except they have a first argument `self`. But we'll explain that later - first, try humming:"

# Creating a specific object
mourek = Kitten()

# Method call
mourek.zamnoukej() 

(Note: This is not a complete sentence in either language, but rather a code snippet.)

"When you define a class (using the `class` block), it doesn't mean that there is a kitten in your program yet. A class is like a recipe or a manual: when you buy a cookbook, you will theoretically know how to bake a cake, what such a cake will look like, and that it can be eaten. But it still doesn't mean that you have the actual cake!"

"You create a specific object by calling a class: you use the class as a function, `Kitten()`, and the result is a new object of your class that you can now use."

"M≈àau!" translates to "Meow!" in English.

Attributes

"In objects created from 'custom' classes, you can set *attributes* - information that is stored with the given object. Attributes are marked by writing a period between the value and the name of its attribute."

The code is in Czech and it creates an object named "mourek" of class "Kotatko". It sets the attribute "jmeno" of "mourek" to the string "Mourek". Finally, it prints the value of "jmeno" attribute, which is "Mourek".

The string `'Mourek'` now "belongs" to a specific kitten. When you create another kitten, you can name it differently - set its attribute `jmeno` to a different string.

``` 

```
micka = Kitten()
micka.name = 'Micka'
``` 

(Note: I assumed that "Kotatko" means "Kitten" and "jmeno" means "name" based on context.)

The given text is actually a code written in the programming language Python. It prints the names of two objects, "micka" and "mourek". Without more context or information about these objects, it's difficult to provide a meaningful translation. However, in English, the code would read:

```
print(micka.name)
print(mourek.name)
```

Note that "jmeno" is the Czech word for "name", which is why "name" appears in the translated code.

Parameter `self`.

"Now let's briefly return to methods. Specifically, to the `self` parameter."

"Each method has access to a specific object it works on, precisely through the `self` argument. Now that you have named the kittens, you can use `self` in the `purr` method to access the name of the specific kitten."

```
class Kitten:
    def meow(self):
        print("{}: Meow!".format(self.name))
``` 

This is a Python code that defines a class `Kitten` with a method `meow()` which prints "Meow!" along with the name of the kitten. The original text was in Czech language.

The translation of the Czech text is: 

mourek = Kotatko()
mourek.jmeno = 'Mourek'

Translation: 

mourek = Kitten()
mourek.name = 'Mourek'

micka = Kitten()
micka.name = 'Micka'

The text is a code in the programming language Python, and it translates to:

```
mourek.meow()
micka.meow()
```

In English, it means "Mourek meow" and "Micka meow", which are two commands for cats to make a meowing sound.

"What happened? The expression `mourek.zamnoukej` creates a *method*. When you call it (`mourek.zamnoukej()`), the `mourek` object is passed to the `zamnoukej` function as the first argument, `self`."

Can such a method take more than one argument?
It can - `self` will be automatically added as the first argument,
the rest of the arguments will be taken from the method call.
For example:

``` 

```python
class Kitten:
    def meow(self):
        print("{}: Meow!".format(self.name))
``` 

This is a class definition in Python for a kitten that has a method called `meow`. When the `meow` method is called, it will print the string "Meow!" along with the kitten's name.

The translated text from Czech to English is: 

"def snez(self, jidlo):
        print("{}: Yum yum! I like the {}!".format(self.jmeno, jidlo))" 

Note: This appears to be a code snippet written in Python, and the translation is a rough interpretation of what the code is doing.

mourek = Kitten()
mourek.name = 'Mourek'
mourek.eat('fish')

"Shrnut√≠" in Czech means "summary" in English.

"Classes can do much more, but the basics are: all objects of a given class have some common behavior (for example, kittens can meow). And at the same time, each object also has its own information, just for it (for example, a kitten's meowing)."

"It is worth writing your own class when you have more objects with similar behavior in the program, or when you just need to have a set of functions (or methods) neatly together."

And that's it.
*You are absolutely great!* 
This was a difficult lesson, so you should be proud of yourself.
We are very proud of you for coming this far!

"Take a short break - stretch, take a walk, close your eyes - before you start the next chapter. :)"

The Czech text "üßÅ" translates to "cupcake" in English.

I'd be happy to help! Please provide me with the Czech text you would like me to translate.
